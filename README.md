Here ML pridication can be made as with so and so features, on what price house is likely to be sold

### Machine Learning Phases
    > Data Collection 
        > Featurization 
            > Model Training - on a subset of orig. dataset 
                > Model Testing - on a different subset of orig. dataset. Retrain to acheive accuracy.
                    > Base Model

### Types of ML 
    - Supervised Learning: Creates pridictive ML models using feauted and lebals - both.
        - Classification: When Labals can be expressed types of classes
        - Regression: When tags/labels are continuous. eg House Labels
    - Unsupervised Learning: Groups & discover patterns only on features.
        - Used for clustering & anamoly detection
